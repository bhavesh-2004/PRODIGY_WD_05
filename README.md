 Developed a weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The app provides real-time weather updates, location-based forecasts, and interactive elements. Integrated external APIs for accurate data and optimized the user interface for a smooth and responsive experience.
